* Do not trust what I say:
    * My Ruby knowledge is 10 years old, ie, outdated
    * My last professional contact with Ruby was 3 years ago
* Tools
    * Official website: http://ruby-lang.org
    * Official docs: http://ruby-doc.org
    * Gems: https://rubygems.org
    * Rake - the "ant" of Ruby
    * VMs / Interpreters
        * CRuby, aka MRI (Matz's Ruby Interpreter)
        * JRuby
        * YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM)
        * You can use RVM to manage the VMs. I myself have only the "system" Ruby, which is more than enough for dev
    * IRB - Interactive Ruby
    * IDEs/text editors
        * No IDEs are needed. In fact, most "hard core" Rubyists don't use one.
        * I'm not hard core: IntelliJ has nice plugins. Those are packaged into another IDE, for people who don't need the full IntelliJ: RubyMine
        * Text editors
            * Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com
            * vim
            * ...
    * Books:
        * Pickaxe: https://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0
        * Ruby Cookbook: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/ruby-cookbook-2nd/9781449373702/
        * Alternative to Pickaxe, available on Safari: The Ruby Programming Language, but it's old.
